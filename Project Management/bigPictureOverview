#**Sweep**

### **What is it?**

           An app to streamline admin, accounting, booking, logistics and customer service for self-employed and small business owners. 

### **User Stories**

           Bert is a chimney sweep. He spends 5 / 6 days week out visiting customers carrying out up to 12 jobs per day. 
	   His working hours are between 8am and 5pm in general but it is not uncommon for him to be out working later due 
	   to unforeseen problems that extend the time taken to complete a job. 

On top of this Bert has to;

- Keep track of existing customer database. (Currently paper based)
- Contact anyone due an annual sweep and book an appointment.
- Search for other customers in the same location and try to book in a days worth of work.
- Create a round to optimise distance travelled to work done ratio.
- Send out confirmation messages the day before he is due to visit.
- Issue Certificate of sweep - (this has insurance implications.) 
- Issue receipts for each job itemising work done and detailing payment method. 
- Follow up banking to ensure receipts have all been paid in full.
- Contact customers who are still to pay with a reminder. 
- Maintain business assets - Van
			   - Tools - brushes, vacuum,
- Manage stock of items sold to customers - guards, fire logs, chimney sheep, rope. 


## **Initial idea**

Doing all of the above on top of a full time schedule of carrying out the job has major impact on the Bert’s quality of life. 
Reducing time spent with family, increasing stress and lack of sleep. 

Many of these tasks could take considerably less time with the use of an effective customer database.

Additional features that could utilise a new customer database could;

-   Alert Bert to customers approaching 12 months since last visit. 
-   Contact these customers with an automated email / text reminder that a sweep is due.
-   Offer the option of accepting a proposed sweep date / time(?) appointment.
-   Group customers by location and optimise routes to optimise distance to work ratio. 
		-Once optimised rounds can be stored for the following year. There is no need for round optimisation every year unless significant improvements can be made. 
-   Offer Bert the option to confirm or edit suggested rounds based on own knowledge or customer availability.  
-   Generate route maps for Bert to follow while working. 
-   Send out confirmation messages (text, email) day prior to visit. 
-   Digitise sweep certificates with default setting to minimise time spent writing out every job. Email copies for customers. 
-   Receipts could be issued in similar way as certificates. 
		-confirmation email of job done with receipt and certificate attached - this should be standardised and sent on completion of job. 
-   Standards are common between certificates and receipts and could be heavily templated but will need the option to edit fields as necessary. 
-   Maintain stock count info and alert Bert (with option to place order?) when levels reach specified lows. 


### **Proposed App Features to Prototype**

#### **Develop functionality for several apps that address specific problems**

1 - Customer database - central to all apps functionality. 
		Get all of Bert’s customer data into a digitised system. (It’s currently paper based!)

2 - Track - Group / order customers by location and date swept. Routes stored for annual repetition with option to add / remove customers as circumstances change. 

3 - Alert / Contact - Alert Bert and contact customers due for annual sweep. Text / Email confirmation once appointment confirmed and reminder of sweep the day before visit.  

4 - Routes - Generate routes optimised for distance travelled to jobs done. Most number of jobs in shortest possible distance and time. 

#### **Future development thoughts**

5 - Analytics - future implementation of data analytics to keep track of business metrics and highlight trends / areas for development. 

7 - Employees - use of app to keep track of business across the team.

8 - Franchise - keep track of business across multiple teams.
